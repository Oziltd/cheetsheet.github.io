        HTML
    </h1>
    <h2> HyperText Markup Language </h2>
    <h5> Using elements within < > we can create simple and effective form of coding to design websites.</h5>
    
    <h3>Key Elements</h3>
    <h4> Head</h4>
    <h5>This allows the file to be read by the machine in the form of metadata. Its title, scripts and stylesheets. </h5>
    <h4>Body</h4>
    <h5>The body elemet represents the content of the HTML document.</h5>
    <h4>Ordered lists and Unordered List</h4>
    <h5>When we explore Ordered and Unordered lists we must understand that Unordered Lists have no numerical order or ranking whilst Ordered Lists do. That is the difference. </h5>

    <h2>Coding Example of HTML</h2>
    <h5>When we explore this it should guide you towards the basic fundementals in how to start a HTML document and the basic elements invovlved.</h3>
   
    <h5 class="CodeH"> !DOCTYPE html</h5>
    <h6>Doctype HTML within < >allows you to indicate to the coding system that it is a html document</h6>
    <h5 class="CodeH">HTML</h5>
    <h6>We use HTML to identify to the metadata that the following data is in HTML format</h6>
    <h5 class="CodeH">head /head</h5>
    <h6> The head element allows us to link the HTML document to other coding programmes like CSS and create a title for the file </h6>
    <h5 class="CodeH">header /header</h5>
    <h6>Imagine in the context of having a footer but for the top of the page with the same context however you would probbaly want to have the logo and title of what your project here.</h6>
    <h5 class="CodeH">body h1 /h1 h2 /h2 p /p /body</h5>
    <h6> Within body we can use different size of fonts with h1 and h2. We can also use p to display to the metadata there is another paragraph within a certain group in the body. Body and Div are different because body shows the metadata what it is while div is unspesific</h6>
    

    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>

    <h4>Typography</h4>
    <h5>When we talk about fonts we explore the font they use and the weight of the font so how bold or italic or thin</h5>
    <h5>
        font-family refers to a family of fonts available for selected elements</h5>
        <h5> font-size sets the text size because texts size can be of different values</h5>
        <h5> letter-spacing allows control on horizontal spacing between characters in selected element</h5>
        <h5>   line-height which sets the line spacing within paragraphs</h5>
        <h5>    text-align how you want to position a line of text (Left, Centre, Right)</h5>
    <h4>Borders</h4>
    <h5>
        border is a shorthand for the border of an element in its entirety
    </h5>
    <h5>
        border-bottom -left -right -top refers to the specific Borders </h5>
    <h5>border-color sets the color of border </h5>
    <h5>border-radius rounds the corners of Borders </h5>
    <h5>border-style self explanatory </h5>
    <h5> border-width </h5>

    <h2>coding examples of CSS</h2>
    <h5>We should be exploring the basic fundementals of CSS coding layout</h5>

    <h3 class="CodeC"> Fonts</h3>
    <h5 class="CodeC3"> Fonts can be all shapes and sizes.</h5>
    <h5 class="CodeC5">Bold</h5>
    <h4 class="CodeC4">Very Bold</h4>
    <h1 class="CodeC2"> Sans Serif</h1>
    <h2 class="Helvetica">Helvetica</h2>

    <h5 class="CodeC1">To edit and explore an element you would simply do:</h5>
    <h5 class="CodeC1">x { }</h5>
    <h5 class="CodeC1">X would be the element and within the brackets you would put in your desired design or edit.</h5>
    <h5 class="CodeC1">Within these brackets there are simple rules, pick your intention so border, then add a ":" and to not disrupt any addition after it you end it on a ";" after you in this case pick if the border is solid or lined, the pixel size and the color.</h5>
